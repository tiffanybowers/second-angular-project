<div id="search-component">
    <h4><label for="search-box">Hero Search</label></h4>
  
    <input #searchBox id="search-box" (input)="search(searchBox.value)" />
  
    <ul class="search-result">
      <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes$ | async" > <!-- $ is a convention that indicates heroes$ is an Observable, not an array.-->
        <a routerLink="/detail/{{hero.id}}">
          {{hero.name}}
        </a>
      </li>
    </ul>

<!--
  NOTES:
  AsyncPipe - Since *ngFor can't do anything with an Observable, 
  use the pipe character (|) followed by async. This identifies Angular's 
  AsyncPipe and subscribes to an Observable automatically so you won't have 
  to do so in the component class.

  Every time the user types in the textbox, the binding calls search() with the 
  textbox value, a "search term". The searchTerms becomes an Observable emitting 
  a steady stream of search terms.

  MORE NOTES:
  With the switchMap operator, every qualifying key event can trigger an 
  HttpClient.get() method call. Even with a 300ms pause between requests, 
  you could have multiple HTTP requests in flight and they may not return 
  in the order sent.

  switchMap() preserves the original request order while returning only 
  the observable from the most recent HTTP method call. Results from prior 
  calls are canceled and discarded.

  Note that canceling a previous searchHeroes() Observable doesn't actually 
  abort a pending HTTP request. Unwanted results are simply discarded before 
  they reach your application code.

  REMEMBER:
  Remember that the component class does not subscribe to the heroes$ observable. 
  That's the job of the AsyncPipe in the template
